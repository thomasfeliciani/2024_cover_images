# Dissertation cover images


## Overview

This repository contains scripts for generating the cover images (book cover and chapter covers) from my PhD dissertation:

> Feliciani, T. (2025). _Divided Spaces and Divided Opinions: Modeling the Impact of Residential Segregation on Opinion Polarization_. ICS dissertation series, Groningen.


The file [walkthrough.html](./walkthrough.html) (built from the R markdown file [walkthrough.Rmd](./walkthrough.Rmd)) shows step-by-step how to generate the cover figures in the dissartion. The html version is too large for GitHub.com to render it. To view it, download the html and open it in any browser.

The `./output/` directory contains a higher-resolution version of these figures, as well as the down-sized versions used in the walkthrough demos.
